This program forms a 1D quantum potential well with the first N eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian having some pre-defined
values given by the user. It begins with a finite square well centered at x=0 and having length L and depth V0. Then
it repeatedly adds perturbation terms that can be expected to move the eigenvalues to the direction of the correct target
values. If the parameters are chosen correctly, the result is a potential energy function and a set of wave function
probability densities of a system where the energies E_1 to E_N are close to the user-defined target values.

As an input, the program takes the length and depth of the initial square well, a lower bound estimate for the ground state energy
of the system, and a fraction F which is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 and tells how much the program is to perturb the system
during a single iteration. These values should be given in decimal form, such as V0 = 200.0 instead of V0 = 200. In addition to this,
the program wants the number N which is the number of lowest eigenenergies to tune, the number of iterations to be made (this, of
course, should be a large number whenever F is small), and the values of target energies E_1 to E_N. The integer values N and the
number of iterations have to be written in integer form such as 4 instead of 4.0, and the energies in decimal form such as
E_2 = 4.0.

All of the target eigenenergies should be numbers between 0 and V0 and given in increasing order (e.g. not E_1 = 5.0 followed by E_2 = 2.0).
It is also not a good idea to set the first eigenenergy E_1 to a value that is much closer to zero than the other energies, e.g.
E_1 = 0.01 and E_2 = 6.0. This is not necessary, either, because in practice the spacings between energies have more importance
than their absolute values.

As an option, you are also asked whether the data for the potential energy function V(x) should be saved in an output file after
every iteration or only after the last one. The first N wave function probability densities of the resulting potential well are
saved in an output file only after the last iteration
